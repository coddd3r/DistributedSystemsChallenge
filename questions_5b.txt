are the offsets universal i.e all-nodes share an offset counter, are they log specific or are they node specific?
why are so many of the poll requests empty?
I get poll requests before the sends
logic: Send:receive a send, add it to it's key in the log using as a tuple (offset, message) using, an offset(starts at 0),
respond with send_ok(counter), counter += 1
Poll: receive a poll request, search for the keys in my node's log, if not present ignore(?), 
if present, filter out all offsets below the requested offset, return the rest of the (offset, message) pairs.

I have tried debugging and it seems I receive a lot of poll requests before send requests that would have populated the keys in the former.
 Here are my workload results:
 :workload {:valid? false,
            :worst-realtime-lag {:time 40.026181086,
                                 :process 12,
                                 :key "9",
                                 :lag 39.495687539},
            :bad-error-types (:inconsistent-offsets
                              :int-poll-skip
                              :poll-skip),
            :error-types (:inconsistent-offsets
                          :int-poll-skip
                          :poll-skip),
 
 

PS: I noticed maelstrom/doc/workloads on the github docs has different commands Read, Write and Cas. Do these matter for the tests?
